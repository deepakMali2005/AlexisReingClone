        "Alexis successfully managed the interior design for a large scale renovation while we were living outside
        the country. What we appreciated most was her unflappable demeanour, her ability to work well in a team
        under pressure and her ability to listen/understand our vision. We absolutely love the results and our home
        is not only beautiful but extremely functional. It truly reflects our personalities."

        "I want to tell you how much we appreciate all your attention to details. Airy with graceful lines & soft
        colors: this is just the vision I had for the Beach House. It is so serene and lovely. Each item is lovely
        on its own & they all harmonize so beautifully together. We love the soft grays, blues & white. The desk in
        my bedroom is a true work of art. The sofa & pillows are gorgeous & comfy.
        <br><br>
        It has been such a wonderful experience to work with you creating this beautiful vacation dream home for us.
        Thank you so very, very much. We very much appreciate your beautiful design sense."

    <div class="testimonial-description">
        "We had a wonderful experience working with Alexis to design a nursery for our son. Alexis was clear when
        outlining the design process and we knew what to expect when working with her. All of our design meetings
        were efficient and enjoyable. Alexis kept us updated on the status of ordering, shipping and delivery on all
        items for the nursery. We had pleasant experiences with all of the service providers she engaged on our
        project.
        <br><br>
        Alexis worked with our vision to create a "sophisticated safari" themed nursery. The nursery design Alexis
        created for the space is absolutely beautiful. The statement blue ceiling is adored by everyone who sees it!
        The wall decorations Alexis chose all hold our son's interest, which is a wonderful bonus. The nursery is
        our favorite room in our home! Thank you for your creativity and expertise, Alexis!"

    <div class="testimonial-description">
        "I have managed many buildings and encountered a variety of interior designers, vendors and contractors.
        Alexis has always been a pleasure to work with. She complies with our rules & regulations, stays on
        schedule, asks the right questions, and overall understands what it takes to make the residents happy. I
        look forward to working with Alexis for many years to come."

    <div class="testimonial-description">
        "Alexis completely transformed our dated NYC apartment into an elegant, cozy and most importantly,
        kid-friendly, home for me and my family. We had begun an enormous gut renovation on our 3500 square foot
        apartment which was overwhelming and thankfully Alexis stepped in and helped us through it. She worked with
        me long distance and through rounds of emails, phone calls, and texts she quickly ascertained what I was
        looking for and put together a cohesive design plan with all the colors, patterns, textures and fabrics I
        loved. She was so thoughtful with every detail and selection which resulted in the apartment really feeling
        like 'me' and not a cookie-cutter, generically decorated apartment. She has an amazing eye for fabrics and
        color and she just made the whole process fun. We can't thank her enough for creating such a beautiful and
        special home for us."

        "Alexis is first and foremost a lovely, intelligent person. She is someone you can feel confident
        representing you and handling your projects, with minimal input from you other than initially.
        <br><br>
        She has excellent taste; designs and keeps schedules; is respected by vendors and contractors and others,
        such as homeowners associations and managers with whom she must work to complete a job. This means
        everything runs smoothly and on time.
        <br><br>
        You would be fortunate to have Alexis agree to take responsibility for your work."

        "We just wanted to let you know how happy we are with how the nursery has turned out. It has a very peaceful
        vibe that makes us want to spend time there. Our baby nurse also 'inspected' it fully today and she's very
        happy too! She *loves* the glider/recliner :-)
        <br><br>
        Thank you for all the hard work and iterations you've done on this. Now it just needs a baby to be
        complete!"
